// [Timers](timers) are for when you want to do
// something once in the future - _tickers_ are for when
// you want to do something repeatedly at regular
// intervals. Here's an example of a ticker that ticks
// periodically until we stop it.

package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Tickers use a similar mechanism to timers: a
	// channel that is sent values. Here we'll use the
	// `range` builtin on the channel to iterate over
	// the values as they arrive every 1s.
	ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Second)
	go func() {
		for t := range ticker.C {
			fmt.Println("Tick at", t)
		}
	}()

	// Tickers can be stopped like timers. Once a ticker
	// is stopped it won't receive any more values on its
	// channel.
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
	ticker.Stop()
	fmt.Println("Ticker stopped")
}
